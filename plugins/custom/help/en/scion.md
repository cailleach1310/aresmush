# Scion Merit
You can choose the advantage of Scion Merit in chargen. The advantage can be bought at levels 1-3, each level at the cost of 2 points. Please be aware that each level needs a justification in your BG, as higher levels require special constellations in parents and perhaps even in the grandparents of your character. Depending on the level of your scion power, staff can allow you special bonuses in situations if your action is made in the spirit and area of your Companion. We don't have a coded scion power system so far, as any particular use will have to be sanctioned by staff anyway. You are of course free to include certain hints at angelic blood into your poses.

## Prerequisites
Taking a scion merit in chargen is only possible for characters of D'Angeline nobility. The scion chosen must be the patron angel of the home province of one of the two parents. For example, if you have a lady of l'Envers with a Shahrizai as her mother, there would be a choice between the scions Naamah and Kushiel. In this case, the lady in question can only take the scion merit advantage at level one.

For level two, both parents must be of noble blood from the same province. This would be something often found in Kusheth, where families prefer to make matches within the province. It does occur of course also in other provinces.

For level three, parents and all grandparents must hail from the same province. This will be comparatively rare in Terre d'Ange of the present day, and most often the result of dynastical considerations.

# Scion Merit
You can choose the advantage of Scion Merit in chargen. The advantage can be bought at levels 1-3, each level at the cost of 2 points. Please be aware that each level needs a justification in your BG, as higher levels require special constellations in parents and perhaps even in the grandparents of your character. Each level grants you one Scion point. These can be spent on using your scion ability. Please note, that scion points regenerate slowly, at 0.5 per week. It is not a thing that is to be used often, instead it is meant to be a tool that can make your character shine in special plot situations.

There are special scion commands for using the particular ability. 

`scion` - Shows the patron angel of your particular scion ability, your level and your current scion point threshold.
`scion/use <level>` - Will record your use of scion ability and subtract the ability cost from your scion point threshold. Only then, you will be allowed to make use of the benefits of the scion ability.

# Marque
This command lets you set your character's marque in chargen. The state of the marque is only visible to yourself and staff, and can later only be changed through the monthly marque raise and the requests you put in about bonuses for assignations that have been referenced in rp.

`marque` - Shows the current state of the marque.
`marque/set <percent>` - Sets your marque to the starting percentage (a value between 0-100).

## Staff Commands

`marque/init <name>` - Sets the marque to a starting value of '0' (which happens usually after the debut).
`marque/raise <name>=<percent>` - Adds progress to the marque (as in the monthly off camera marque raise).
`marque/list` - Lists all characters with marques in progress.

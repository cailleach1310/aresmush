# Marque
This command lets you set your character's marque. The state of the marque is only visible to yourself and staff, and can later only be changed through the monthly marque raise and the requests you put in about bonuses for assignations that have been referenced in rp.

`marque` - Shows the state of the marque.
`marque/set <percent>` - Sets your marque to a value between 0-100.
